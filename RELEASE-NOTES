* 2.22:
** Modify so that an error loading a config file (.maplev) does not prevent maplev from loading
* 2.21:
** Added maple 16
** Buttonize include statements; clicking them opens the file.
   The functionality respects include file delimiters (angle brackets
   or double quotes) and acts accordingly, using maplev-include-path
   to provide the include path of searchable directories.  A heuristic
   is used if the normal searches fail; that allows most includes to just
   work.
** Search and load a maplev configuration file, which can be project specific.
   The configuration file is elisp.  A typical use is to set maplev-include-path
   (which is now buffer-local) so that the buttonizing (above) works properly
   with the project.
