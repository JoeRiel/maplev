* 2.21:
** Added maple 16
** Buttonize include statements; clicking them opens the file.
   The functionality respects include file delimiters (angle brackets
   or double quotes) and acts accordingly, using maplev-include-path
   to provide the include path of searchable directories.  A heuristic
   is used if the normal searches fail; that allows most includes to just
   work.
** Search and load a maplev configuration file, which can be project specific.
   The configuration file is elisp.  A typical use is to set maplev-include-path
   (which is now buffer-local) so that the buttonizing (above) works properly
   with the project.  
* 2.20:
** Handle leading tilde in symbols (new with Maple 16; used for coercion).
** Improve README.
* 2.19:
** Eliminate compilation errors
* 2.18:
** Added 'subset' to reserved words (Maple 7!)
** Added 'upperbound' and 'lowerbound' to builtin functions
