* 2.27:
** Font-lock 'static' (as special word)
** Improve regular expression match for simple-names
** Fix issue with mint and include statements
* 2.26:
** Add customizable flag maplev-include-file-other-window-flag
** Add $elif and $file as preprocessor directors
** Font-lock lastexception
* 2.25:
** bind C-c C-o to button to open include files
* 2.24:
** fix bug when creating include file.
* 2.23:
** fix bug finding include path.  If include file not found, but path exists, query to create.
** refactor maplev-auto-fill.
** Advise fixup-whitespace to catenate strings and remove space from leading comma,
   these are used with delete-indentation.
* 2.22:
** Modify so that an error loading a config file (.maplev) does not prevent maplev from loading
* 2.21:
** Added maple 16
** Buttonize include statements; clicking them opens the file.
   The functionality respects include file delimiters (angle brackets
   or double quotes) and acts accordingly, using maplev-include-path
   to provide the include path of searchable directories.  A heuristic
   is used if the normal searches fail; that allows most includes to just
   work.
** Search and load a maplev configuration file, which can be project specific.
   The configuration file is elisp.  A typical use is to set maplev-include-path
   (which is now buffer-local) so that the buttonizing (above) works properly
   with the project.  
* 2.20:
** Handle leading tilde in symbols (new with Maple 16; used for coercion).
** Improve README.
* 2.19:
** Eliminate compilation errors
* 2.18:
** Added 'subset' to reserved words (Maple 7!)
** Added 'upperbound' and 'lowerbound' to builtin functions
