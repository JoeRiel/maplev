	* maplev.el (maplev--compute-indent): 
	Set case-fold-search to nil when checking for 
	maplev--declaration-re.

2003-10-10  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (complete-symbol-function): removed.

2003-10-09  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	- Added (require info) so maplev-goto-info-node compiles (still
	doesn't work).
	- Fixed all mode-map assignments; used characters for letter
	symbols (a -> ?a).
	(event-window): Used defun rather than defsubst so that it would
	byte-compile in Xemacs.  I don't understand why this is necessary.
	(event-point):  Used defun rather than defsubst, see above.
	(maplev-cmaple--lock-access): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in put.
	(maplev-cmaple--unlock-access): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in put.
	(maplev-cmaple--locked-p): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in get.
	(maplev-cmaple-status): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in get.
	(complete-symbol-function): added variable to permit the user to
	bind maplev-complete-symbol to a particular key.
	(maplev-mode): Make complete-symbol-function local to the MapleV
	buffer and set it to maplev-complete-symbol.
	(maplev-complete-symbol): Added optional prefix argument.  
	This isn't currently used, but permits passing an optional prefix,
	which could be used to choose a particular symbol list.

2003-10-09  Roland Winkler  <Roland.Winkler@physik.uni-erlangen.de>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev-align-exclude-rules-list): Fix docstring.
	(maplev-completion-release): New variable used for selecting the
	correct maple release when calculating the lazy minibuffer
	completion.
	(maplev--list-to-word-re) Use eval-and-compile.
	(maplev--grammar-keyword-re): Use eval-when-compile.
	(maplev-cmaple--start-process) Use identity for mapconcat.
	(maplev-cmaple-pop-to-buffer): Don't call
	maplev--completion-initialize.
	(maplev-ident-around-point-interactive): Use new function
	maplev--completion.
	(maplev--completion-initialize): Removed.
	(maplev--completion): New function for lazily calculating the
	minibuffer completion. The first time it is used for a certain
	Maple release it calculates and stores the completion table in
	maplev-completion-alist. Subsequent calls merely extract the
	relevant portion of maplev-completion-alist.
	(maplev-complete-symbol): Use maplev--completion.

	(maplev--special-words-re): added eval-when-compile
	(maplev--initial-variables-re): added eval-when-compile
	(maplev--mouse-keymap): new function to handle defining mouse
	button keymaps, specifically differences between Emacs and Xemacs.

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev--special-words-re): removed eval-when-compile
	(maplev--initial-variables-re): removed eval-when-compile

2003-10-05  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el

2003-02-15  Joe Riel  <joe@clifford>

	that Maple preprocessor directives are not indented.
	(maplev--preprocessor-directives-re): Assigned regex constant to
	match a preprocessor directive.
	(maplev-font-lock-keywords-1): Added font-locking of preprocessor
	directives.
	(maplev-preprocessor-face): Added custom face for font-locking
	preprocessor directives.  Xemacs may define font-lock-preprocessor-face.

	* maplev.el:
	(maplev-goto-info-node): Added this interactive function [NOT WORKING!]
	(maplev-menu): Added menu item to run `maplev-goto-info-node'.
	(maplev--grammar-alist): Changed grammar for `use' so
	that it doesn't look for an `in'.  This is part of the kludge
	to allow the use of the Maple `in' operator.
	(maplev--completion-initialize): renamed from maplev-completion-initialize.
	(maplev-help--cleanup-buffer): renamed from maplev-help-cleanup-buffer.
	(maplev--short-delay): renamed from maplev-short-delay.

	(maplev-cmaple--send-string): renamed from maplev-cmaple-send-string.
	(maplev-cmaple-send-region): Changed so that it calls maplev-cmaple--clear-buffer
	if a prefix was applied to the command.
	(maplev-cmaple--clear-buffer): New function.  Clears the cmaple buffer.

	(maplev-insert-copyright-flag): Corrected docstring.
	Changed coding system to unix; this may get reset
	when the file is uploaded/downloaded to the website.
	Removed iso-latin copyright symbol, replaced with `(C)'.

2002-10-01  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	Added (require 'align) to customize alignment rules for Maple.
	Added variables for aligning Maple assignments.
	Created a new custom group, maplev-align. 

2002-09-30  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev-initial-abbrev-mode-flag): Changed default value to nil so
	that abbreviations are initially disabled.  This was done to
	prevent a new user from being unable to figure out how to type,
	say, ``wh'', as a variable.  With abbreviations enabled this would
	expand to ``while''.
	(maplev--statement-terminator): modified regexp; removed match to
	start of line and removed first match group.
