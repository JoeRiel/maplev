2009-12-11  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-help-fontify-node): 
	Added font-locking of comments.
	Modified code for selecting See Also hyperlinks
	to work with Maple 14, which generates a line space
	after the See Also.  May need tweaking

2009-12-10  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--protected-names-re): 
	Added 'restart' and 'with'.

2009-11-01  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-help-follow-mouse): 
	Check whether topic is in a package overview, if so,
	prepend the package name.  Hmm, this won't always work,
	suppose the link is to a help page in another package.
	Oh well...

2009-09-12  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--protected-names-re): 
	Addede curry, rcurry, is, real

2009-07-28  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev-comment-to-string-region): convert comments to embedded strings.
	(maplev-string-to-comment-region): inverse of above.

2009-06-26  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--possibly-typed-assignment-re): 
	New regular expression suggested by Erik; now used in
	maplev--indent-point-of-proc to permit matching 
	static methods of objects:  method :: static := proc()...end proc.

2009-04-19  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--protected-names-re): 
	regex to match standard Maple protected names (circa release 13).
	(maplev-font-lock-keywords-3): add protected names to font-lock
	level 3.
	(maplev-protected-face): Face for font-locking protected names.

2009-02-05  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-help-fontify-node): 
	Added fontification of help hyperlinks.
	It's overly aggressive...o
	(maplev--activate-hyperlink): 
	New function to assist activating hyperlinks;
	split out from maplev--activate-hyperlinks.

2009-01-17  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>
	* maplev.el abstract: Implemented Erik's patch, which provides a
	function for adding variable declarations in a multiline format.
	Extended it to provide two multi-line formats: trailing-comma and
	leading-comma.  Also provided option to alphabetize the
	declarations.
	(maplev-add-local-variable)
	(maplev-add-declaration-trailing-comma)
	(maplev-add-declaration-leading-comma)
	(maplev-add-declaration-one-line)
	(maplev-alphabetize-declarations-p)
	(maplev-add-declaration-function)

2009-01-15  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-fill-paragraph): 
	(fixed tab insertion)
	(maplev--compute-indent): Fixed bug where local_xxx is
	interpreted as a 'local'.  Forced use of proper syntax table.
	(maplev-mode-map): bound new func maplev-what-proc
	(maplev-what-proc): new command; displays the name of the
	current procedure in the echo area.  Bound to C-h M-d.
	"d" was chosen because originally I named this maplev-describe-proc.

2008-06-07  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* Makefile
	Fixed.  Added --no-site-file to emacs.
	Without this, the elc doesn't work (is tiny).

2008-06-05  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--builtin-functions-alist): 
	12: added Record, rtable_size.  Backquoted some names.
	

2008-05-19  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-goto-info-node): 
	Fixed.

2008-02-22  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--help-section-re): 
	Added "Options" to section headers.

2008-02-21  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--grammar-alist): 
	Modified assignment to maplev--grammar-alist
	to avoid a minor byte-compile nag.

2008-02-20  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--help-section-re): 
	Added "Notes" and "Algorithm" to section headers.
	These mainly appear in internal help pages.

2007-11-01  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--preprocessor-directives-re): 
	Added "elif" to preprocessor macro list
	(maplev--preprocessor-directives-re): 
	Removed "elif".  Maple documentation was wrong,
	it does not exist.  Submitted SCR 54831.

2007-10-23  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--deprecated-re): 
	New regex.  Not yet used.

2007-07-08  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--update-indent-info):
	Added comparison of keyword to "*)" to handle multiline comments.
	Not sure this is the best way.
	(maplev--grammar-keyword-re): 
	Added "(*" and "*)" so that they can (later) be distinguished
	from "(" and ")".  Too bad syntax matching regexps don't skip
	the (syntatic) comment markers.

2007-05-25  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mode-syntax-table): 
	Changed syntax table so << .. >> act as multiline comments.
	This is useful with noweb.  Should be limited to there...

2007-05-24  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mode-syntax-table): 
	Updated syntax table to handle Maple 12 nested multiline comments:
	(* ... *).

2007-04-07  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el [documenting previous changes]
	(maplev-executable-alist): Added entries for maple 10 and 11.
	(maplev-default-release): made 11.
	(maplev-init-string-alist): added entry for 11
	(maplev--reserved-words-alist): added entry for 11
	(maplev--builtin-functions-alist): added entry for 11

2007-03-01  Joe Riel  <joer@san.rr.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--special-words-re): 
	Added _options, _noptions, etc to special words list.

2006-06-23  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--assignment-re): 
	Modified so that it procedures entered as table entries
	are typeset as follows:
	  , myproc = proc() 
	    local x
	        ...
	    end proc
	Also added optional forward quotes around name.
	This was done in a crude manner, they may not match.
	

2006-06-02  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mint-include-dir): 
	New custom variable, used to assign a directory
	to search for $include files.   Probably should
	be a list of directories, but I'm not sure how to 
	handle that.
	(maplev-mint--goto-source-pos): 
	Added optional argument FILE.
	(maplev-mint--goto-source-proc): 
	Modified to handle a source file in an $include statement.

2005-09-17  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--help-process): 
	Removed assigning interface(screenheight=24).
	That was done to control tty plotting, however, because I implemented it badly
	(it echos in the cmaple buffer) it is bothersome.  Better to just
	call plotsetup(X11) or plotsetup(maplet).

2005-06-15  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--validate-indent-info): 
	Added check for noweb-minor-mode.  
	(maplev-clear-indent-info):
	Changed from maplev--clear-indent-info.
	Made this interactive.
	(maplev-mode-map): 
	Assigned (maplev-clear-indent-info) to the key C-c-tab-k.

2005-03-01  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--reserved-words-alist): 
	Added "uses" to reserved word list for Maple 10.
	(maplev--declaration-re): Addes "uses" to declaration regexp.

2005-02-02  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-executable-alist): added "10" for maple10 to linux section.
	Need to update Windows part.  Actually, this whole thing should be redone.
	(maplev-init-string-alist): added "10".
	(maplev--reserved-words-alist): added "10".
	(maplev--builtin-functions-alist): added "10".

2004-10-01  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev--template-proc): was maplev-template-proc.
	(maplev--help-section-re): Modified to handle subpackages.
	Also added References section.
	(maplev-help-fontify-node): Stopped hyperlink highlighting
	following "SeeAlso" upon encountering a blank line.
	(maplev--template-proc-module): was maplev-template.
	(maplev-mode-map): added key for maple-template-use-statement
	(maplev-help-mode-map): Fixed typo in (space) key.  This still may not work.
	(maplev-mint-fontify-alist): Added Module to regex for maplev-mint-proc-face

2004-09-29  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-align-rules-list):
	Added rule for aligning type declaration, that is, (::).

2004-09-21  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev--compute-indent): Let case-fold-search to nil in top-most
	let statement.
	(maplev-mint-fontify-alist): Added Module to regex for
	maplev-mint-proc-face.

2004-07-20  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-history-delete-item): 
	Added `when' so that code is executed only if the stack exists.

2004-07-14  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mode-syntax-table): Made `&' a word
	constituent so that the neutral operator &to, for example, would
	not be matched as a keyword (to).  

2004-06-21  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--update-indent-info): 
	Added calls to save-restriction and widen to prevent errors 
	in parse-partial-sexp when the valid stack point is outside
	a current restriction.

2004-06-17  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev--generate-initial-completion-alist): Pulled code out of
	maplev-complete-symbol and put here.  Added extraction of symbols
	from ?index/package.  Made selection of symbols more robust.
	(maplev-complete-on-module-exports): New function for adding the
	exports of a module to the completion alist.
	(maplev-add-exports-of-module-at-point): This the interactive
	function.
	(maplev-cmaple-direct): New function for interfacing directly with
	cmaple.  Its rather crude, essentially it permits sending a one
	line input and returns the one line output.

2004-06-11  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mint--goto-source-line): New procedure for
	moving point to the referenced line in the maple source.  Added a
	list item to maplev-mint-fontify-alist and modified
	maplev-mint-handler to use this functionality.

	* maplev.el 
	- Replaced functions used for selecting and demarking
	defuns (procedures and modules).
	
	  Deleted                    Added
	  -------                    -----
	  maplev-beginning-of-proc   maplev-beginning-of-defun
	  maplev-end-of-proc         maplev-end-of-defun
	  maplev-scan-proc
	  maplev-proc-beginning      maplev--beginning-of-defun-pos
	  maplev-proc-end            maplev--end-of-defun-pos
	  maplev-proc-bounds     
	  maplev-mark-proc           maplev-mark-defun
	  maplev-narrow-to-proc      maplev-narrow-to-defun
	  maplev-current-proc        maplev-current-defun

	The new functions are not just different in name; some of them are
	complete rewrites.  While "defun" has no intrinsic Maple meaning,
	I used it because it wasn't clear that "proc" would also include
	modules.  The optional "level" parameter that was used with many
	of the original functions has been removed; it complicated things
	and seemed of relatively little use.

	- Redid regular expressions, using the shy group operator.
	Modified maplev--defun-begin-re so that the first group is the
	complete name of the defun.  This fixed Imenu support so that it
	works with indexed names.
	
2004-06-10  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--end-of-defun-pos): New procedure for finding
	the end of a Maple defun.  It replaces maplev-end-of-proc.  

2004-06-08  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--re-search-forward): Rewrote so that it works
	correctly when |count| <> 1.  The previous version did not check
	whether intermediate matches (those counted past) are in comments.
	Did the same with maplev--re-search-backward.

2004-06-03  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-delete-vars): Rewrote to handle variables with
	type declarations.

2004-06-02  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev-mint-fontify-alist): Used shy group operator
	in regular expressions to eliminate the need for the SUBEXP
	element in the alist.  Updated maplev-mint-fontify-buffer to
	reflect the change.
	
2004-05-24  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--update-indent-info): Used unwind-protect to
	swap syntax tables so that underscores are treated as word
	constituents during indentation parsing.  This permits using
	variables with names like fee_fi_fo_fum; previously the
	indentation routine would break on the "fi".  During normal
	editing, the underscore is treated as a symbol constituent, this
	permits easily editting a portion of the symbol using word
	commands.  This technique was copied from the ada-mode.el.

	The current implementation probably doesn't work for R4 source.

2004-05-19  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--help-definition-re): Assign regular
	expression for dictionary references (hyperlinks) in help pages.
	(maplev-help-fontify-node): Add code for activating dictionary
	hyperlinks.

2004-01-29  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (maplev--compute-indent): 
	Set case-fold-search to nil when checking for 
	maplev--declaration-re.

2003-10-10  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el (complete-symbol-function): removed.

2003-10-09  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	- Added (require info) so maplev-goto-info-node compiles (still
	doesn't work).
	- Fixed all mode-map assignments; used characters for letter
	symbols (a -> ?a).
	(event-window): Used defun rather than defsubst so that it would
	byte-compile in Xemacs.  I don't understand why this is necessary.
	(event-point):  Used defun rather than defsubst, see above.
	(maplev-cmaple--lock-access): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in put.
	(maplev-cmaple--unlock-access): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in put.
	(maplev-cmaple--locked-p): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in get.
	(maplev-cmaple-status): forward-quoted 'maplev-release in get.
	(complete-symbol-function): added variable to permit the user to
	bind maplev-complete-symbol to a particular key.
	(maplev-mode): Make complete-symbol-function local to the MapleV
	buffer and set it to maplev-complete-symbol.
	(maplev-complete-symbol): Added optional prefix argument.  
	This isn't currently used, but permits passing an optional prefix,
	which could be used to choose a particular symbol list.

2003-10-09  Roland Winkler  <Roland.Winkler@physik.uni-erlangen.de>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev-align-exclude-rules-list): Fix docstring.
	(maplev-completion-release): New variable used for selecting the
	correct maple release when calculating the lazy minibuffer
	completion.
	(maplev--list-to-word-re) Use eval-and-compile.
	(maplev--grammar-keyword-re): Use eval-when-compile.
	(maplev-cmaple--start-process) Use identity for mapconcat.
	(maplev-cmaple-pop-to-buffer): Don't call
	maplev--completion-initialize.
	(maplev-ident-around-point-interactive): Use new function
	maplev--completion.
	(maplev--completion-initialize): Removed.
	(maplev--completion): New function for lazily calculating the
	minibuffer completion. The first time it is used for a certain
	Maple release it calculates and stores the completion table in
	maplev-completion-alist. Subsequent calls merely extract the
	relevant portion of maplev-completion-alist.
	(maplev-complete-symbol): Use maplev--completion.



2003-10-08  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	- Changed all mode-map assignments to define keys using a notation
	  that is compatible with both FSF Emacs and Xemacs.
	- Modified all mouse key maps to use maplev--mouse-keymap (see below).
	- Added Time-Stamp field.
	(maplev--list-to-word-re): assigned inside eval-when-compile
	(maplev--special-words-re): added eval-when-compile
	(maplev--initial-variables-re): added eval-when-compile
	(maplev--mouse-keymap): new function to handle defining mouse
	button keymaps, specifically differences between Emacs and Xemacs.

2003-10-07  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev--special-words-re): removed eval-when-compile
	(maplev--initial-variables-re): removed eval-when-compile

2003-10-05  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev-executable-alist): Added items for Maple 9.
	(maplev-default-release): Made Maple 9 the default
	(maplev-init-string-alist): Added Maple 9 item
	(maplev--reserved-words-alist): Added Maple 9 reserved word list (same 8)
	(maplev--builtin-functions-alist): Added Maple 9 builtin function list

2003-02-17  Joe Riel  <joer@k-online.com>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev--string-re): Fixed to match when the sring contains an escaped newline.
	

2003-02-15  Joe Riel  <joe@clifford>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev-include-path): Defined custom variable for setting include path.
	(maplev-cmaple--start-process): Added code to insert include path option.
	(maplev-mint-region): Added code to insert include path option.
	
2003-02-10  Joe Riel  <joe@clifford>

	that Maple preprocessor directives are not indented.
	(maplev--preprocessor-directives-re): Assigned regex constant to
	match a preprocessor directive.
	(maplev-font-lock-keywords-1): Added font-locking of preprocessor
	directives.
	(maplev-preprocessor-face): Added custom face for font-locking
	preprocessor directives.  Xemacs may define font-lock-preprocessor-face.

	

2002-10-04  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el:
	(maplev-goto-info-node): Added this interactive function [NOT WORKING!]
	(maplev-menu): Added menu item to run `maplev-goto-info-node'.
	(maplev--grammar-alist): Changed grammar for `use' so
	that it doesn't look for an `in'.  This is part of the kludge
	to allow the use of the Maple `in' operator.
	(maplev--completion-initialize): renamed from maplev-completion-initialize.
	(maplev-help--cleanup-buffer): renamed from maplev-help-cleanup-buffer.
	(maplev--short-delay): renamed from maplev-short-delay.
	(maplev-cmaple--start-process): renamed from maplev-cmaple-start-process.
	(maplev-cmaple--send-string): renamed from maplev-cmaple-send-string.
	(maplev-cmaple-send-region): Changed so that it calls maplev-cmaple--clear-buffer
	if a prefix was applied to the command.
	(maplev-cmaple--clear-buffer): New function.  Clears the cmaple buffer.

2002-10-03  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el (v2.15)
	(maplev-align-rules-list): 
	Added rules for aligning commas and columns (|);
	they are applied only if a prefix argument is applied.

2002-10-02  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	(maplev-insert-copyright-flag): Corrected docstring.
	Changed coding system to unix; this may get reset
	when the file is uploaded/downloaded to the website.
	Removed iso-latin copyright symbol, replaced with `(C)'.

2002-10-01  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el 
	Added (require 'align) to customize alignment rules for Maple.
	Added variables for aligning Maple assignments.
	Created a new custom group, maplev-align. 

2002-09-30  Joe Riel  <joe.riel@incep.com>

	* maplev.el
	(maplev-initial-abbrev-mode-flag): Changed default value to nil so
	that abbreviations are initially disabled.  This was done to
	prevent a new user from being unable to figure out how to type,
	say, ``wh'', as a variable.  With abbreviations enabled this would
	expand to ``while''.
	(maplev--statement-terminator): modified regexp; removed match to
	start of line and removed first match group.
