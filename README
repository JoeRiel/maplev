VERSION 2.19

This package provides Emacs modes for developing Maple code.
Maple is computer algebra system sold by Maplesoft Inc.

The major modes are

 - maplev-mode : edit Maple source files 
 - maplev-mint : view the output of mint, a Maple syntax checker
 - maplev-help : view Maple help pages
 - maplev-proc : view archived Maple procedures
 - maplev-cmaple : interface with a Maple engine

INSTALLATION
------------
On a linux system you should be able to run

$ ./install

That byte-compiles and installs the lisp files,
copies the info page, and updates the info dir node.
You may need to modify the file for your system.

If that does not work, here are the manual steps.

Copy the files to locations appropriate on your system.
Here is where I put the various files:

   lisp/maplev.el --> $HOME/.emacs.d/maple
   doc/maplev     --> $HOME/share/info

Under the doc subdirectory is an html format of the maplev manual.  It
may be useful if you do not have Emacs or info installed and so cannot
read the info file (maplev).

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Modify your .emacs file.  I have the following in mine

(setq load-path (cons (format "%s/.emacs.d/maple" (getenv "HOME")) load-path))
(autoload 'maplev "maplev" "Maple editing mode" t)
(setq 
 auto-mode-alist (cons (cons (concat "\\." (regexp-opt '("mpl" "tst") t)
				     "$")
			     'maplev-mode)
		       auto-mode-alist)
 maplev-copyright-owner "Joseph S. Riel" ; this is for applying copyrights to Maple code you create
 maplev-default-release "15"
 maplev-executable-alist 
 '(
   ("15" . ("maple15" nil "mint15"))
   ("14" . ("maple14" nil "mint14"))
   ("13" . ("maple13" nil "mint13")))
 maplev-mint-query nil
 maplev-description-quote-char ?\"
 )


USAGE
-----
Fire up Emacs.  If you configured auto-mode-alist, as above,
opening a Maple source file with extension .mpl should case
it to be opened in maplev-mode.
