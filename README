MapleV: An Emacs Package for Maple Developers

MapleV is an Emacs package for developing code for Maple, a computer
algebra system sold by Maplesoft.  MapleV provides several major modes:

 - maplev-mode : edit Maple source files
 - maplev-mint : view the output of mint, the Maple syntax checker
 - maplev-help : view Maple help pages
 - maplev-view : view archived Maple modules and procedures
 - maplev-cmaple : interact with a Maple engine

Requirements

 - GNU Emacs 25.1+
 - Maple 2016+

To interact with the Maple engine, display help pages, and view
library procedures, the _pmaple_ binary executable and a Maple
library, maplev.mla, are required.  Those are available at
github.com/JoeRiel/maplev.  They can also be installed from Maple
via the MapleCloud by executing

  PackageTools:-Install(TBD, 'overwrite');
  maplev:-Unpack();
