;;
;; Button-lock is a minor mode which provides simple facilities to
;; define clickable text based regular expressions.  Button-lock.el
;; piggybacks on font-lock.el, and is efficient.  Overlays are not
;; used.
;;
;; Button-lock buttons (links) can execute any function.
;;
;; See wiki-nav.el for a user-friendly library built on top of
;; button-lock.el.  Wiki-nav.el is available here:

;; Example usage
;;
;;    (require 'button-lock)
;;    (global-button-lock-mode 1)
;;
;;    ; add a mouseable button to all occurences of a word
;;    (button-lock-set-button "hello" 'beginning-of-line)
;;
;;    ; to remove that button later, pass all the same arguments to
;;    ; button-lock-unset-button
;;    (button-lock-unset-button "hello" 'beginning-of-line)
;;
;;    ; or, to remove the most recently added button
;;    (button-lock-pop-button)
;;
;;    ; create a fancy raised button
;;    (button-lock-set-button "hello" #'(lambda ()

;;
;; Notes
;;
;;    By default, button-lock uses newfangled left-clicks rather than
;;    Emacs-traditional middle clicks.
;;
;;    Font lock is very efficient, but it is still possible to bog
;;    things down if you feed it expensive regular expressions.  Use
;;    anchored expressions, and be careful about backtracking.  See
;;    `regexp-opt'.
;;
;;    Some differences between button-lock.el and hi-lock.el:
;;
;;       * The purpose of hi-lock.el is to change the _appearance_
;;         of keywords.  The purpose of button-lock is to change the
;;         _bindings_ on keywords.
;;
;;       * Hi-lock also supports embedding new keywords in files,
;;         which is too risky of an approach for button-lock.
;;
;;       * Hi-lock supports overlays and can work without font-lock.
;;
;;    Some differences between button-lock.el and buttons.el
;;
;;       * Buttons.el is for inserting individually defined
;;         buttons.  Button-lock.el is for changing all matching text
;;         into a button.
;;
;; Compatibility
;;
;;     Tested on GNU Emacs 22 - 24.
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Case-sensitivity of matches depends on how font-lock-defaults
;;     was called for the current mode (setting
;;     font-lock-keywords-case-fold-search).  So, it is safest to
;;     assume that button-lock pattern matches are case-sensistive --
;;     though they might not be.
;;
;;     Return value for button-lock-set-global-button is inconsistent
;;     with button-lock-set-button.  The global function does not
;;     return a button which could be later passed to
;;     button-lock-extend-binding.  The other global functions are
;;     similarly inconsistent; they can only be depended on to return
;;     nil on failure.
;;
;;     button-lock-mode gets activated twice for each buffer when
;;     global-button-lock-mode is on.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Consider defining mode-wide button locks (pass the mode as the
;;     first argument of font-lock-add-keywords).  Could use functions
;;     named eg button-lock-set-mode-button.
;;
;;     language-specific navigation library (header files in C, etc)
;;
;;     example of exchanging text values on wheel event
;;
;;     right-click menus
;;
;;     button-down visual effects as with Emacs widgets

"Attach mouse actions to text via `font-lock-mode'.

Required argument PATTERN is a regular expression to match.

Required argument ACTION is a function to call when the matching
text is clicked.  A quoted function name or a lambda expression
may be given.  The function called by ACTION must be interactive.
If ACTION is not valid the user may experience a silent failure.

If the function called by ACTION uses (interactive \"e\") it may
receive the relevant mouse event.  Note that you may wish to use
the mouse event to reposition the point.

Following PATTERN and ACTION is a Common Lisp-style series of
keyword/value arguments:

:FACE is a font face to set on matching text, like hi-lock mode.
By default, :FACE has no properties, and :FACE-POLICY is :APPEND.
This means that other, existing text properties will take
priority, and that clickable text will not be distinguished
without a mouseover.  To change this, try adding the arguments
\":face 'link :face-policy 'prepend.\" Alternatively,
`button-lock-face' may be customized.

:MOUSE-FACE is the font face to set on mouseovers.  It defaults
to `button-lock-mouse-face'.

:FACE-POLICY sets the override policy for button faces.  Useful
values are nil, 'keep, 'prepend, and 'append (the default).  See
the documentation for OVERRIDE in `font-lock-keywords'.

:HELP-TEXT is applied to the help-echo text property, and may
become visible in a tooltip depending on your Emacs setup.

:GROUPING designates a subgroup in the pattern match to receive
the new text properties.  Subgroups, delimited by parentheses,
are numbered from 1.  The default :GROUPING is 0, indicating the
entire match.

:MOUSE-BINDING sets the mouse event which will invoke ACTION.
The default is 'mouse-1.

:KEYBOARD-BINDING sets a keyboard event which will invoke ACTION.
The format is as accepted by `kbd'.  The default is nil, meaning
no keyboard binding is in effect.  If this is set, it might also
be wise to alert the user by setting :FACE.  Note, the only
difference between :MOUSE-BINDING and :KEYBOARD-BINDING is
that :KEYBOARD-BINDING is interpreted by `kbd'.  It is possible
to pass keyboard events into :MOUSE-BINDING and vice versa.

:KEYBOARD-ACTION is an alternate event to be run by
:KEYBOARD-BINDING.  The default is nil, meaning that
:KEYBOARD-BINDING will invoke ACTION.  This is intended for cases
where ACTION is dependent on the position of the mouse. See also
`button-lock-extend-binding' for a general method of adding
alternate bindings.

:ADDITIONAL-PROPERTY defines an arbitrary text property which
will be set to t in for text which matches PATTERN, as optionally
modified by :GROUPING. The property 'button-lock will always be
set.

As a convenience, :MOUSE-2 through :MOUSE-5 can be used to attach
an alternate ACTION, as can :M-MOUSE-1 ..., :A-MOUSE-1 ...,
:DOUBLE-MOUSE-1 ..., :WHEEL-UP..., and :WHEEL-DOWN... The list is
not exhaustive.  For a general method of adding alternate
bindings, see `button-lock-extend-binding'.

If :REMOVE is non-nil, any button matching the exact properties
given will be removed and forgotten by font-lock.

If successful, this function returns the button which was added
or removed from `font-lock-keywords'. Otherwise it returns nil.
The button value can be passed to `button-lock-extend-binding'."
