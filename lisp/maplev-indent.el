;;; maplev-indent.el --- Indentation engine for MapleV

;;; Commentary:
;; 

;; The indentation functions handle the indentation of Maple code.
;; They are based on the Maple-mode package written by Nicholas
;; Thie'ry.  Considerable changes have been made to handle the
;; extended syntax introduced in Maple R6.  Following is a brief
;; description of the algorithm.
;; 
;; The buffer local list variable `maplev--update-indent-info' stores
;; the indentation information at a particular point, call it the
;; `known-indent-point' (the point position is stored in the list).
;; When a line is indented, the algorithm checks whether the current
;; position is greater than `known-indent-point'; if so, it only needs
;; to check between that point and the current position.  If not, it
;; needs to search backwards for a known valid indentation point.  The
;; function `maplev--validate-indent-info' handles this.
;;
;; The amount that a particular line is indented is determined by the
;; grammar defined by the constant assoc list `maplev--grammar-alist'.

;;; Code:
