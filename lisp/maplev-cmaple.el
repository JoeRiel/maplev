;;; maplev-cmaple.el --- Communicate with Maple process

;;; Commentary:
;; 

;; Define the functions used for communicating with the command line
;; Maple process.
;;
;; A useful feature is having independent Maple processes associated
;; with particular (source) buffers.  Doing so will require rewriting
;; the access control, however, it should result in a more robust
;; design.  Is it worth it? 
;;
;; One method to accomplish this is the following:
;;
;;  - Create a (source) buffer-local variable that stores the process.
;;  - Create an (output) buffer-local flag variable that stores the lock status.
;;
;; To check whether the process is locked, make the output buffer the
;; current buffer and check its flag variable.  When a second source
;; buffer (first) requires a Maple process, the user should be queried
;; (dependent on a configuration variation)  whether it should use an
;; existing Maple process, provided it is of the proper release.
;; Independent Maple output buffers should be numbered sequentially.
;;
;; A difficulty, or at least a nusiance, is handling the help and proc
;; modes.  Ideally all source buffers that have the same Maple release
;; would use a common help or proc buffer.  However, because proc may
;; depend on the state of Maple, its buffer must be associated with a
;; specific Maple process.  The straightforward solution is to have a
;; separate help or proc buffer associated with each independent Maple
;; process.  It leads to more buffers than I'd like.
