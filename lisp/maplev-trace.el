;;; maplev-trace.el --- handle Maple trace output

;;; Commentary:

;; Maple tracing provides a convenient way to record the internal
;; execution of selected Maple procedures.  See ?trace.  When tracing,
;; Maple prints enter and exit markers for the traced procedures and
;; the result of each assignment during the execution.
;;
;; These Elisp functions use the embedded markers to indent the output
;; hierarchically so that one can see how deep a call is; this is
;; useful when debugging recursive calls.  For the output to be
;; sensible, interface(prettyprint=0) should be in effect.

;;; Code:
