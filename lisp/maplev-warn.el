;;{{{ Intro
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a minor mode warning about suspicious
;; syntax in Maple files.  It is inspired by Emacs' CWarn mode.
;;
;; Currently, it warns about the use of != for comparisons: you
;; probably meant to write <> instead, which means ``unequal'' in many
;; programming languages but which Maple interprets as two operators,
;; ``factorial (LHS) equals RHS''.

;; Usage:
;;
;; MapleV-warn is implemented as two minor modes: `maplev-warn-mode' and
;; `global-maplev-warn-mode'.  The former can be applied to individual buffers
;; and the latter to all buffers.
;;
;; Activate this package by Customize, or by placing the following line
;; into the appropriate init file:
;;
;;    (global-maplev-warn-mode 1)
;;
;; Also, `font-lock-mode' or `global-font-lock-mode' must be enabled.
